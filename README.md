# Reprodex
Reprodex enables users to offer bounties for the reproduction of their research conclusions by researchers and domain-experts, thereby strengthening their results. 
Qualification tokens ensure only qualified reviewers with anonymous identities can take up the bounties. A smart contract deployed on the SKALE Calypso Hub manages decentralized payments and bounties. Click below to mint the qualification token for all specialties and submit a test request. In production, these tokens should be assigned selectively to reviewers based on their qualifications.
